# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator
This Python project implements a statistical calculator that computes the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum of values across the rows, columns, and flattened form of a 3 x 3 matrix using NumPy.

It includes robust error handling and comprehensive unit tests to verify correctness.

# Features
1. Accepts a list of 9 numerical values as input

2. Converts the list into a 3x3 NumPy array

# Computes:
1. Mean

2. Variance

3. Standard Deviation

4. Maximum & Minimum

5. Sum

# Outputs results for:
1. Each row

2. Each column

3. The entire matrix (flattened)

4. Returns results as a clean dictionary structure

5. Handles input errors (e.g., less than 9 elements)

6. Includes full unit test suite

# Technologies Used
1. Python 3

2. NumPy

3. unittest for testing
