# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator
This Python project implements a statistical calculator that computes the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum of values across the rows, columns, and flattened form of a 3 x 3 matrix using NumPy.

It includes robust error handling and comprehensive unit tests to verify correctness.

# Features
Accepts a list of 9 numerical values as input
Converts the list into a 3x3 NumPy array

# Computes:
Mean
Variance
Standard Deviation
Maximum & Minimum
Sum

# Outputs results for:
Each row
Each column
The entire matrix (flattened)
Returns results as a clean dictionary structure
Handles input errors (e.g., less than 9 elements)
Includes full unit test suite

# Technologies Used
Python 3
NumPy
unittest for testing
